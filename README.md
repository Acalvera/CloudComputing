**TUTORIAL FOR THE CLOUDCOMPUTING COURSE AT UNIUPO**

  In this tutorial you will learn how to create your own script that will allow you to interact easily with chamaleon cloud via the **CLI inteface**. The **goals** of the tutorial are to learn how to use the CLI interface by using *openstack* and how to set up and run *docker containers*, all in an **easy way**. 
  
  This script (cli_interface.sh) allows the user to perform the following operations:
  
    路 Launch a new fully customized instance
    路 Launch a new already customized instance
    路 Remove an instance
    路 List all the instances
    
  Along with the option to install (on instance creation) some docker containers to monitor the instance created (monitoring_set_up.sh).
